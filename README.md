# Uniswap Eagle ðŸ¦…

## Project Overview

Uniswap Eagle is an open-source application that uses Chainstack's subgraph to index data from Uniswap and displays a list of token pairs.

With Uniswap Eagle, users can fetch any amount of token pairs created in the Uniswap Liquidity pool.

The app takes in an input of the `number` of Uniswap token pairs a user will want to view.

The app returns the unique `Pool ID` - that points at that pair, `Token Name`, `Contract Address` and `Token Symbol` of the two token pairs created and a link to enable the user `View Token on Etherscan`

## Project Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/midesofek/uniswap-eagle
cd node-frontend
```

2. Start the project
   > node index.js

## Graph Infrastructure

- **Chainstack** - to robustly index data on the uniswap-v3 factory contract

## Packages Used

- **node-fetch** - to fetch data from the deployed subgraph through http requests
- **express** - to simplify the nodejs build process
- **dotenv** - to protect the Chainstack-Query URL used in the project

## Chainstack Integration

In order to effectively listen to the `PoolCreated` event emitted by the Uniswap-v3 Contract, there was a need to map the data stored on the blockchain and index the day into a more easily understandable and accessible format, and utilizing a subgraph is undoubtedly the best way to do it.

### Why Chainstack Subgraph?

Chainstack subgraph was particularly utilized to cut down on stalling response delays, with the goal of providing users with faster response and a smoother experience when querying uniswap data through Uniswap Eagle.

## Upcoming Releases

- _RealTime Data on all transactions based on Particular ETH Swaps_
- _RealTime Data on Certain Contract Deployments_
